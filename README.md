# moodvie

Moodvie is a project created during Code First Girls 2020 Hack from Home, where teams were challenged to code together during the time of crisis to find a solution to a problem. The problem we identified and decided to solve was the [decision fatigue](https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_the_paradox_of_choice) faced when finding something to watch, as in the current COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown people are spending a considerable amount of time indoors. Therefore, we at Moodvie aim to ease your browsing experience by deciding for you!
